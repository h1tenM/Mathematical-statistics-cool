A new method of training was suggested, and a test was conducted to compare the new method with the standard procedure. Two groups of nine new employees each were trained for a period of 3 weeks, one group using the new method and the other following the standard training procedure. The length of time (in minutes) required for each employee to assemble the device was recorded at the end of the 3-week period.\n",
