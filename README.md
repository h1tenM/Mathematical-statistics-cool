# Mathematical Statistics Visualizations

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key concepts in probability theory and mathematical statistics. The notebooks were created to help tutor students by providing clear, visual explanations of abstract statistical ideas through practical coding examples.

The notebooks consist of visualizations of interesting statistical concepts from my class, including the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), consistency of estimators, exponential distributions using pivotal quantities, bootstrap methods, likelihood functions for Bernoulli trials, and various confidence interval derivations. Each notebook is self-contained, allowing users to explore specific statistical concepts in isolation.

The implementation uses Python with standard scientific computing libraries (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization tools (Matplotlib). This resource serves both as a teaching aid and a reference for those looking to strengthen their grasp of mathematical statistics through applied examples.
